# README.md

## About

This is a README.md file for my maze project. I created this project to learn more about mazes and to challenge myself to create a maze that is both challenging and fun to play.

## Story

I have always been a fan of mazes. I remember when I was a kid, I would spend hours playing with mazes. I would try to find the fastest way to the end, or I would try to find all the hidden paths. I loved the challenge of solving a maze, and I loved the feeling of accomplishment when I finally found my way out.

As I got older, I started to think about mazes in a different way. I started to think about them as a metaphor for life. In life, we are all faced with challenges. We have to make choices, and we have to deal with the consequences of our choices. Sometimes, we get lost. But if we keep trying, we can always find our way back to the right path.

That's why I chose to work on this project. I wanted to create a maze that would be challenging and fun, but that would also have a deeper meaning. I wanted to create a maze that would make people think about life and about the choices they make.

## Technical details

I used the following technologies to create this maze:

* C++
* CMake


I started by creating a simple maze. I then played the maze myself and tried to solve it. I found that the maze was too easy to solve. I then made the maze more difficult by adding more walls and dead ends. I played the maze again and found that it was too difficult to solve. I then made the maze more fair by adding more paths and shortcuts. I played the maze again and found that it was both challenging and fair.

I also faced a challenge when it came to creating the visuals for the maze. I wanted to create a maze that was visually appealing and that would keep players engaged. I experimented with different colors, shapes, and patterns. I also experimented with different soundtracks. I finally found a combination of colors, shapes, and patterns that I was happy with. I also found a soundtrack that I thought was catchy and that would keep players engaged.

## How to play

To play the maze, follow these steps:

1. Use the arrow keys to move your character around the maze.
2. Avoid the walls and dead ends.
3. Try to find the exit.

## Tips

Here are a few tips for playing the maze:

* Look for patterns in the maze. This can help you to find the exit.
* Use the walls to your advantage. You can use them to block off certain areas of the maze.
* Don't be afraid to experiment. Try different paths and see where they lead you.

## Enjoy!

I hope you enjoy playing my maze. Please let me know if you have any feedback or questions.
